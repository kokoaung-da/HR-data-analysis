# Atliq Presence Insights Dashboard

🎯 Goal

The aim of this project is to study how often employees come to the office, work from home, or take leave.
By looking at this data, I wanted to help the company understand attendance behavior and make better HR and work policy decisions.

| SL % | 1.1% | Employees on sick leave |

💡 Key Findings

1. Good Overall Attendance

Most employees come to work regularly (91.8% present).

Only 1.1% of days are sick leave — showing people are healthy and active.

Impact: The company has a reliable and hardworking team.

2. Work-from-Home Pattern

Friday has the highest WFH (13%), meaning people prefer to work from home before the weekend.

Monday has less WFH (8.8%), meaning most people come to office to start the week.

Impact: The company can use this information to plan a better hybrid work schedule.

3. Day of Week Trend

Monday has the highest presence (93.2%).

Friday is a bit lower (90.2%).

Saturday and Sunday have 0% attendance (normal 5-day week).

Impact: Best days for meetings or team work are Monday to Wednesday.

4. Employee Performance

Most employees have 85–100% presence – very consistent.

Some employees (below 80%) may need support or discussion.

Impact: HR can find and help employees who are not attending regularly.

5. Monthly Trend

Attendance stayed stable from April to June.

WFH increased slowly — more people are adapting to flexible work.

Sick leave went up a little in May–June, maybe because of seasonal sickness.

Impact: Helps company plan projects and manage staff during low attendance times.
